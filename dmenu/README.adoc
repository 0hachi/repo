== 🔍 dmenu

faye's fork of the generic menu for X +
my config has unused patches; it's nothing but laziness 😥

=== 💄 aesthetics
* input field theme
* prompt theme
* transparency
* border

=== ⭐ qol
* access-ordered list `.desktop` runner (luajit)
* emoji menu (jq, xclip)
* case insensitive
* fuzzy matching
* highlight
  ** further patched by me so it's case-insensitive (thus, matching fuzzy finder & case insensitive patches)

=== 🌍 tweaks
* line height
* grid nav
* center
* grid
* xyw
